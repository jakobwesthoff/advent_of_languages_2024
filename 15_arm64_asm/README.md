# Advent of languages: Arm64/Aarch64 Assembler

This is an arm64/aarch64 version of our christmas tree implementation.

It has been written to be executed on an "Apple Silicon Mac" (eg. M1, M2, ...).
It uses macOS specific syscalls and syscall conventions. Therefore running it
on an arm64 linux device, for example, is not possible without changes.
