# Advent of languages 2024

Over the course of the days before christmas this repository will be filled
with an implementation of more or less the same little project in 24 different
programming languages.

Each day a corresponding live coding video will be published on my YouTube
channel [MrJakob](https://youtube.com/c/mrjakob).

You can find all of the videos belonging to this repository in the following playlist:

The code of the corresponding video will be available here, sometime on the day of the videos release.

## The blueprint

Each of the little implementations should in the end create and display a
christmas tree on the text console, when run. Variations and additions for each
of the language might of course occur.
