# Advent of language

Over the course of the days before christmas this repository will be filled
with an implementation of more or less the same little project in 24 different
programming languages.

Each day a corresponding live coding video will be published on my YouTube
channel [MrJakob](https://youtube.com/c/mrjakob).

## The blueprint

Each of the little implementations should in the end create and display a
christmas tree on the text console, when run. Variations and additions for each
of the language might of course occur.

```
        /\
       /  \
       /  \
      /  o \
      /    \
     / u    \
     --------
        ||
        ||
```
